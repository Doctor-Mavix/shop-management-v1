                The School of Remedial Studies organizes Remedial classes for students
                with deficiency in some vital O-level subjects relevant to their course of
                study. Depending on the relevance of the subject to your choice of course,
                you either finish the Remedial before getting full Admission or you
                combine it with your degree studies.

              <h3>Indigenous Language Courses</h3>
              <p>
                vision of changing the face of Education, we offer courses in native
                languages. If you want to study in your native language, you have to
                enquire to know the courses that are available. Even language is not a
                barrier in Afriford.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the moment we are in collaboration with different Institutes in Africa
                to develop many courses up to degree level in different languages. Our
                intention is not to replace the English and French with native languages
                but rather to reach out to those natives who are fluent in their native
                languages, both reading and writing but who have little or no mastery of
                foreign languages. We have started translating Textbooks to native
                languages.
